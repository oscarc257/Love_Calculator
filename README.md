# Love_Calculator

A project using Python, that depicts the logic of love compatibility into code. 

The code in main.py is a love calculator program. It takes the input of two names, combines them and converts the combined string to lower case. Then, it counts the occurrences of the letters "t", "r", "u", and "e" in the combined string, and calculates a value 'true' based on the counts. Similarly, it calculates the counts of "l", "o", "v", "e" to get a value 'love'. It then combines 'true' and 'love' into a love score.

The program then checks the love score, and displays a message based on the score. It also asks for the names of two persons and calculates a percentage based on the length of the names and the matching of the first and last characters.
